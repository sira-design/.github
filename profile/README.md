ðŸ‘‹  Hi! This is [Sira](https://sira-design.party), an open source, highly customizable and accessible design system, which currently provides TailwindCSS component class name library.

Our main repository is here ðŸ‘‰ [Sira](https://github.com/sira-design/sira).

Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build a wide variety of websites and apps, while providing a consistent and inclusive user experience to our end users.
In addition, the design system and component library should be easy to use for developers and designers.
